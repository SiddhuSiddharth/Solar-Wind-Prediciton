# Solar-Wind-Prediciton

**Solar Insights:** as we have nicknamed it is a novel Data mining approach to predict Solar wind calamities using Jupyter Notebook. After evaluation for finding the best VARMA time series orders using a NASA / NOAA dataset and building a model based on different periods (feature in the dataset). To predict Disturbance Storm Index (DST) generative models can be used.

To run this on your computer:
1. Download the jupyter notebook file.
2. Upload it to your google drive and your kaggle key
3. Import the neceassry libraries given in the prerequisites
4. Run all the jupyter cells one by one
5. Observe the results and record your observations

These are the SARIMAX results for every DST category alike.

These are the VARMAX results for all the necessary features.
